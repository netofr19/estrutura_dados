# Bubble Sort

Also known as the exchange algorithm, or bubble algorithm. It is a simple sorting algorithm, the idea being that it traverses the vector several times, and each time, 'floats' the largest element in the sequence.

This movement is reminiscent of the way bubbles in a reservoir of water seek their own level.

This method, although considered effective, ends up going through the same vector positions several times in the worst case, executing the loop again, returning to the beginning and traversing the vector until it finishes.

It is not recommended for programs that need speed.
